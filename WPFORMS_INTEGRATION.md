# WPForms → RC Flight Operations

This guide connects your **WPForms Membership Application** (form 6569) on pvmac.com to RC Flight Operations via **Uncanny Automator**. Submissions land in **Applications** as pending until staff approve them.

## 1. RC Flight Operations setup

1. Run the latest `schema_full.sql` migration on your database (or deploy the app update so the `member_applications` table exists).
2. Log in as admin → **Administration → Installation**.
3. Under **WPForms integration**, set a long random **Webhook secret** and save.
4. Note the endpoint URL shown on that page, e.g.  
   `https://your-rcflightops-domain/api_webhook_application.php`

Optional: you can also set `application_webhook_secret` in `config.php` if you prefer file-based config.

## 2. Uncanny Automator recipe

Create a **new recipe** (your existing Sender.net recipe can stay — both run on the same form submission).

| Setting | Value |
|---------|--------|
| **Trigger** | WPForms → User submits a form → Membership Application (6569) |
| **Action** | Webhooks → Send data to webhook (or outgoing HTTP POST) |
| **URL** | Your `api_webhook_application.php` URL |
| **Method** | POST |
| **Data format** | JSON |
| **Authorization** | `Bearer <your secret from Installation>` (or header `X-Webhook-Secret`) |

### Request body

Send form fields as JSON key/value pairs. Use WPForms field **labels** as keys (e.g. `Name: First`, `AMA #`, `Address: Zip`). Map values using Automator tokens from the form trigger.

**Recommended Automator JSON** (form 6569 — use each value as the matching Automator token):

```json
{
    "Name: First": "{{10641:ANONWPFFORMS:6569|14|name|first}}",
    "Name: Middle": "{{10641:ANONWPFFORMS:6569|14|name|middle}}",
    "Name: Last": "{{10641:ANONWPFFORMS:6569|14|name|last}}",
    "Address: Address Line 1": "{{10641:ANONWPFFORMS:6569|19|address|address1}}",
    "Address: Address Line 2": "{{10641:ANONWPFFORMS:6569|19|address|address2}}",
    "Address: City": "{{10641:ANONWPFFORMS:6569|19|address|city}}",
    "Address: State": "{{10641:ANONWPFFORMS:6569|19|address|state}}",
    "Address: Zip": "{{10641:ANONWPFFORMS:6569|19|address|postal}}",
    "Phone": "{{10641:ANONWPFFORMS:6569|21}}",
    "Emergency Contact": "{{10641:ANONWPFFORMS:6569|177}}",
    "Emergency Phone": "{{10641:ANONWPFFORMS:6569|179}}",
    "Email": "{{10641:ANONWPFFORMS:6569|23}}",
    "Relationship": "{{10641:ANONWPFFORMS:6569|178}}",
    "Date of Birth": "{{10641:ANONWPFFORMS:6569|157}}",
    "New Member or Renewal": "{{10641:ANONWPFFORMS:6569|30|label}}",
    "New Member (Renewal Period Closed)": "{{10641:ANONWPFFORMS:6569|113|label}}",
    "Initiation Fee": "{{10641:ANONWPFFORMS:6569|187}}",
    "Membership Type": "{{10641:ANONWPFFORMS:6569|47|label}}",
    "Membership Type (Renewal)": "{{10641:ANONWPFFORMS:6569|48|label}}",
    "Membership Type (Prorated)": "{{10641:ANONWPFFORMS:6569|49|label}}",
    "Processing Fee": "{{10641:ANONWPFFORMS:6569|165}}",
    "Total (Membership + Fees)": "{{10641:ANONWPFFORMS:6569|120}}",
    "FAA Registration Number": "{{10641:ANONWPFFORMS:6569|28}}",
    "FAA Registration Expiration": "{{10641:ANONWPFFORMS:6569|137}}",
    "AMA #": "{{10641:ANONWPFFORMS:6569|27}}",
    "AMA Expiration": "{{10641:ANONWPFFORMS:6569|156}}",
    "Entry ID": "{{10641:WPFENTRYTOKENS:WPFENTRYID}}",
    "Application Submission Date": "{{10641:ANONWPFFORMS:6569|162}}",
    "Badge Photo (.jpg, .jpeg, .png), 5Mb Max": "{{10641:ANONWPFFORMS:6569|71}}",
    "FAA Registration (.jpg, .jpeg, .png), 5Mb Max": "{{10641:ANONWPFFORMS:6569|70}}"
}
```

JSON keys must match each WPForms field **label** exactly. If you rename a field label in WPForms, update the matching key in Automator (the app also accepts common aliases such as `Badge Photo` — see `wpforms_application_field_aliases()` in code).

`Address: Country` is sent by WPForms but is not stored on the member record (US club addresses only need city/state/zip).

**Important — use `|label` on choice fields:** For radio/select fields (membership type, new vs renewal), pick the Automator token that ends in **`|label`**, not the raw option value. Without it, Automator may send `1` instead of `Adult - $80.00`, which breaks membership dues on the review screen. Hidden conditional fields can also leak ghost values (e.g. `New Member` in the renewal-closed field during prorated season); the app ignores those when a prorated membership choice is present.

Minimum useful payload example:

```json
{
  "Entry ID": "335",
  "Name: First": "Brent",
  "Name: Last": "Vartanian",
  "Email": "member@example.com",
  "Date of Birth": "06/22/1954",
  "Phone": "+19098999814",
  "New Member (Renewal Period Closed)": "New Member",
  "Membership Type": "Adult - $160.00",
  "AMA #": "931788",
  "AMA Expiration": "12/31/2026",
  "Total (Membership + Fees)": "216.58",
  "Application Submission Date": "06/29/2026"
}
```

WPForms payment gateway metadata (transaction IDs) is often **not** available as Automator tokens; `Total`, `Initiation Fee`, `Processing Fee`, and `Special Code (If you have one)` are usually enough for staff review.

**Currency encoding:** Uncanny Automator sometimes sends dollar amounts with `$` as HTML entities (`&#36;50.00` or `&amp;#36;50.00`). The app decodes these before parsing fees and totals.

Map payment fields using Automator tokens from the **field labels** in the dropdown — not guessed field IDs. Example keys:

- `Initiation Fee` → `$50.00`
- `Processing Fee` → `$4.19`
- `Total (Membership + Fees)` → final amount charged (e.g. `$0.00` when a coupon zeroes the cart)
- `Membership Type (Prorated)` / `Membership Type` → label with dues, e.g. `Adult - $80.00`

## 3. Staff workflow

1. Applicant submits WPForms on the website (payment collected there).
2. Application appears in **Applications** (navbar badge shows **total pending across all years**).
3. Staff review details, suggested member match, payment breakdown, and uploaded file links.
4. **Approve** → member is created or updated → **badge photo** (if submitted) is downloaded from the website and saved on the member record → redirects to **Signup/Renewal recording** (`member_process.php`) with suggested renewal type/year.
5. Staff record payment/fulfillment and print badge/letter as usual (website payment is not auto-posted to the ledger).

For day-to-day review UI details (filters, pagination, payment display), see **[docs/applications.html](docs/applications.html)** in the in-app Help center.

### Review screen

Open **Applications** from the top nav (also linked from **Members** and the dashboard “Needs attention” card when pending items exist).

| Area | What you see |
|------|----------------|
| **Status tabs** | Pending (default), Approved, Rejected, or All |
| **Renewal year** | Defaults to the **current renewal year** so older seasons stay out of the way; choose **All years** for history |
| **Search** | Name, email, or WPForms entry # |
| **List** | Newest first; **50 per page** with pagination when there are more |
| **Detail panel** | Applicant info, address, AMA/FAA, uploaded file links, payment breakdown, suggested member match, diff vs existing member |

If pending applications exist in **other renewal years** while you are filtered to the current year, a yellow banner offers **Show all years** so nothing is missed.

### Payment display

The **Payment (from website)** section shows:

- Membership dues (parsed from the membership type label, e.g. `$80.00` from `Adult - $80.00`)
- Initiation and processing fees
- **Subtotal** when all three line items are present
- **Special code** and “(coupon applied)” when the total paid is less than the subtotal
- **Total paid** from `Total (Membership + Fees)`

This is for **review only** — approving an application does not post a payment row. Continue on **Process Signup / Renewal** to record what the club actually received.

### Approve, reject, and cleanup

- **Approve & continue to recording** — creates a new member or updates the matched member, then opens renewal recording with suggested type/year (staff can override before approving).
- **Badge photo on approve** — when the application includes a badge photo URL from WPForms, the app downloads the image from your WordPress site (JPEG or PNG; GIF also accepted) and sets the member's `photo_path` so **Print card** works immediately on Process Signup / Renewal. **FAA registration card** — when the application includes an FAA registration upload URL, the app downloads it (JPEG or PNG from WPForms) and sets the member's `faa_card_path` so it appears on the Compliance tab. If either download fails (wrong format, unreachable URL, file too large), approval still succeeds and a warning asks staff to upload the file manually on the member record.
- **Reject** — marks the application rejected and removes it from Pending; the row is kept for audit under the **Rejected** tab.
- **Delete test data** — there is no in-app delete yet. To remove test submissions entirely (e.g. so the same WPForms entry ID can be re-sent), delete rows from `member_applications` in the database. Rejecting alone does not free the entry ID for webhook replay.

## 4. Seasonal form behavior

The app infers application type from your conditional fields:

| Season | Signal field | Kind |
|--------|--------------|------|
| Oct 15 – Dec 31 | `New Member or Renewal` = Renewal | Renewal |
| Oct 15 – Dec 31 | `New Member or Renewal` = New Member | New (renewal season) |
| Jan 1 – Jun 30 | `New Member (Renewal Period Closed)` = New Member | New (regular) |
| Jul 1 – Oct 14 | `Membership Type (Prorated)` filled | New (prorated) |

## 5. Field map reference

Full label → app field mapping lives in `includes/wpforms_application.php` (`wpforms_application_field_aliases()`). Key fields:

- Identity: `Name: First`, `Name: Last`, `Email`, `Date of Birth`
- Phone: `Phone` (member); `Emergency Phone`, `Emergency Contact`, `Relationship`
- Address: `Address: Address Line 1` … `Address: Zip` (line 2 promoted if line 1 empty)
- Compliance: `AMA #`, `AMA Expiration`, `FAA Registration Number`, `FAA Registration Expiration`
- Membership: `Membership Type`, `Membership Type (Renewal)`, or `Membership Type (Prorated)`
- Payment: `Total (Membership + Fees)`, `Initiation Fee`, `Processing Fee`, `Special Code (If you have one)`
- Files: **Badge photo** — JPEG/PNG URL from WPForms; copied to the member record on approve for badge printing. **FAA registration** — JPEG/PNG URL from WPForms; copied to the member record on approve for the Compliance tab. AMA card photos are no longer collected on the website form; staff verify AMA via the member record **Verify AMA membership** action after approval. Limit WPForms upload fields to `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, and `.png` so mobile camera uploads work reliably.

Optional in `config.php`: `wpforms_media_hosts` — array of allowed hostnames for badge photo and FAA card download (default `pvmac.com`, `www.pvmac.com`). The server must have **cURL** enabled and be able to reach those upload URLs over HTTPS.

## 6. Testing

Test with curl (replace URL and secret):

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://your-domain/api_webhook_application.php' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Webhook-Secret: YOUR_SECRET' \
  -d '{"Entry ID":"test-1","Name: First":"Test","Name: Last":"Applicant","Email":"test@example.com","Membership Type":"Adult - $160.00","New Member (Renewal Period Closed)":"New Member"}'
```

Expected response: `{"ok":true,"application_id":1,"duplicate":false}`

## 7. Email notifications

When **Support email** is set in Installation, a notification is sent for each new pending application.

## 8. Sender.net and reminder opt-out

Website applicants are typically added to your Sender.net **newsletter/members** list via a separate Uncanny Automator recipe on the same form. Applicant emails are stored **lowercase** in RC Flight Operations to match Sender.

AMA/FAA expiry reminders use Sender’s API when configured under **Administration → Installation → Sender.net (reminder opt-out)**:

- Set the **API token** and **members group ID** (required for auto-added reminder recipients).
- Set **`canonical_host`** or **`public_base_url`** in `config.php` so reminder emails include logo and unsubscribe URLs when cron runs.
- Reminders check **transactional** (`temail`) opt-out — unsubscribing from newsletters does **not** block reminders.
- Each reminder includes a signed link to **`unsubscribe.php`** on this app (reminder-only opt-out).

See [docs/admin.html](docs/admin.html#sender-opt-out) in the Help center.
